# Rimworld Zat Gun (Zat'nik'tel)

Both of the weapons developed by the Goa'uld. 

The Zat'nik'tel (Zat Gun), delivers a charged electromagnetic pulse that incapacitates 
pawns for 10,000 clicks, making it trivial to collect your prize. One shot stuns. Two shots kills. 
Rumors about the third shot are greatly exaggerated.

The Ma'Tok (Staff Weapon) is a true weapon of great terror. They are, in essence, hand-held plasma 
cannons in the form of a staff, capable(in the show) of blowing holes straight through your enemy's torso. :D

This is a real Zat Gun (Zat'nik'tel) and Staff Weapon (Ma'Tok) from the Stargate Universe.

This is the perfect weapon for penal colonies, mental breaks etc. 

The pawn will be downed for several seconds (with minimal injuries), easily allowing capture. 
The risk of death is the equivalent to a single charge rifle bullet hitting them.
